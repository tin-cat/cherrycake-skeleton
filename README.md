Cherrycake is a low level programming framework for developing modular, efficient and secure PHP web applications.

Unlike content management systems and fully-featured frameworks like AngularJS, React or Laravel, Cherrycake sits only as a foundation layer upon which you can build virtually any kind of application.

The aim of Cherrycake is to provide you with a methodology that feels comfortable, rational and easy to use while reaching only the fundamental structural layers of your application, so you keep complete freedom on the fun layers.
